Wilocate is a wireless detector tool capable to geolocalize your current position and the wifi networks around.

The program can be used for

    Showing the geographical location of wireless router on Google Map.
    Geolocating your current position with a pretty good accuracy, like a (sometime inexact) GPS.
    Showing detailed technical informations about wireless networks installed around.
    Wardriving with geographic map support. 

The program supports Linux and is currently under heavy development, help us to improve it and fix some bugs. Soon we'll publish Debian/Ubuntu packages. The georeferenced WiFi? data used to geocode your request was collected when Google was driving around taking pictures for StreetView?. 

Execute

    cd wilocate
    ./wilocate.py
